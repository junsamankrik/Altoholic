1.13.011 (20/06/2021)

- DataStore_Crafts : fixed the color of enchanting recipes in the skill panel, which were all displayed as orange.
You must reload the profession once to fix the database entries.
- Fixed the enchanting profession in the character's tab. Filtering by enchant name now also working.

1.13.010 (19/05/2021)

- Fixed a profession scanning issue where recipes of one profession could be stored into another profession.
If you were affected by this, just reopen your professions once.

1.13.009 (17/05/2021)

- Removed the debug text displayed when opening a craft window. Sorry about this one.
- Added tracking for raid encounter kills. Note that bosses killed were just saved in the previous version, but in an improper format.
Be sure to reload alts with raid id's (it only affects the agenda tab, but you will get an error when mousing over raids of alts you have not reloaded).
- Fixed a lua error when opening the "Beast Training" window.
- [frFR] fixed problems related to "Secourisme/Premiers soins".
- Fixed multiple minor issues related to professions.
- Fixed searching profession recipes.

1.13.008 (13/05/2021)

- Fixed Enchanting
- Summary Tab - Miscellaneous : Fixed guild info not properly reset when leaving a guild
- Summary Tab - Added a faction filter for "this faction"
- Fixed a Search issue related to the localized faction name. enUS & frFR clients were not affected, but most likely all other locales were.
This is a proper fix to a bug I tried to fix earlier but only made worse :(
Unfortunately, for some of you, reloading alts will be necessary. 
Do not fully clean your SV files, but if you detect something fishy related to an alt's faction, just reload it.
This issue may impact faction filtering in the account summary too. 

1.13.007 (02/05/2021)

- Fixed profession cooldowns not properly updating the agenda.
- Fixed a localization issue in DataStore_Crafts that impacted non-enUS clients.

1.13.006 (25/04/2021)

- Fixed a Lua error in the date service, triggering a problem in the Agenda Tab.
- DataStore_Talents : fixed an issue when scanning talents.
- DataStore_Talents : fixed an issue checking the specialization of a low level alt.
- Agenda Tab : fixed reporting of professions cooldowns, and some refresh issues.
- Added tracking of the salt shaker cooldown.
- Fixed multiple issues with account sharing, it should now work without problems.
- Added support for LibDeflate, data transferred using the account sharing feature is now compressed, and the whole process is now much faster.
Note that data transfer is still throttled, while the whole process will be 3-4 times faster than it was, it will never be lightning fast.

Many thanks to Painstorm for his assistance :)

1.13.005 (08/04/2021)

- Fixed a Lua error when mousing over some recipes.
- Fixed a Lua error in the event management.
- Fixed professions cooldowns.
- DataStore_Talents : fixed an issue that could cause account sharing not to work properly.
- DataStore_Inventory : fixed a potential division by zero when scanning the inventory of a naked alt (Thanks qwarlocknew for finding this one !).
- Fixed the recipe tooltips : the "already know by" information is now correct.

Note that this relies on parsing the tooltip, and that it may occasionally fail.
This is the fallback method that has been present in the add-on almost since the beginning, and for Classic, this is the best I can do until a recipe
database is available (recipe x teaches item y, and it would still not be perfect since some items can be created by multiple professions !).
The Classic API does not return the spell ID of a profession's specific item craft, and that makes it a real pain to make a proper unique match.

While limited, this greatly improves the situation though.

Also note that on Classic, I only have 2 low level alts (none is 60 yet), and I don't have all professions.. 
so please report if you have a problem, and be very specific :)


1.13.004 (28/03/2021)

- Agenda Tab : Fixed a Lua error using C_Calendar.
- The account sharing functionality has been reactivated. I could not test it extensively, please report if you have problems.
- DataStore_Crafts : Added support for the localized profession names which may not be unique in some regions.

1.13.003 (22/03/2021)

- Summary Tab : fixed the tooltip of tradeskills, where the amount of recipes was improperly reported.
- Search Tab : fixed a Lua error preventing all searches.

1.13.002 (21/03/2021)

Release Candidate - not released publically.

- Summary Tab : added the miscellaneous menu item, as on retail.
- Characters Tab : talent trees are now working.
Note: Talent trees are working, but not finished. I intend to bring back the feature as I had implemented it in earlier retail versions, 
where you could see a guildmate's talent tree from the interface. This will be back, hopefully soon, this is why you already have a second
greyed out tree on the right of the panel.

- Agenda Tab : is now working.
- Grids Tab : Fixed a few Lua errors, and added missing icons for the reputations.
- Grids Tab : added a panel for the raid attunements.
- Grids Tab : added a panel for keys and key-like items (ex: Scepter of Celebras), with the dungeon to which they are related and the appropriate level.

1.13.001 (9/02/2020)

- Altoholic Summary : should be working fine, but limited to "account summary", "bags", "skills", "activity"
- Altoholic Characters : should be working fine, except for the talents.
- Altoholic Search : should be working fine
- Altoholic Guild : should be working fine, but only contains the "guild" and not the "guild bank" since it did not exist in classic.
- Altoholic Agenda : NOT WORKING, you should disable DataStore_Agenda.
- Altoholic Grids : should be working fine, but limited to "Equipment", "Reputations", "Daily Quests", "Tradeskills"
    Reputations used to get their icons from the related achievements, which do not exist in Classic, so icons are bad/missing.

- DataStore_Achievements + Currencies + Garrisons + Pets : not supported at all in Classic
 (and thus not part of this package)
- DataStore_Agenda + Stats + Talents : are provided as-is, they need to be adapted for Classic, they should be DISABLED in the addon list.
- Other DataStore modules : should be working fine.

- Added the sell price of items in the tooltip, and an option to show/hide it.
